            I'm Xiaolei Zhang. I have a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Data Science from Lingnan University. I have a strong knowledge base in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Mining. I have previous experience as a Data Extraction Assistant at Shenzhen Century Health Medical Technology Co., Ltd, where I analyzed health data in the campus health management system and identified potential health risk factors. I also worked as a Database Builder Assistant at Zhejiang Haidu Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd, where I designed a storage plan for the database and developed future storage requirement plans. Additionally, I have actively participated in various activities, including being a participant in the AIÃ—HK OpenCup 2023 competition and volunteering. I have proficiency in languages such as English and Mandarin, and possess IT skills in MS Suite, WEKA, SPSS, Matlab, Python, Arena, and MySQL. I look forward to utilizing my skills and expertise in new challenges.
